WHAT THIS PACKAGE DOES

  This package provides the ISO image file of UEFI BIOS which is compatible with
  CD/DVD/BD writing software to create the CD/DVD/BD for the UEFI BIOS update.
  Hereafter the CD/DVD/BD for the UEFI BIOS update is called as "BIOS Update CD".

  The BIOS Update CD can boot the computer disregarding the operating systems
  and update the UEFI BIOS (including system program and Embedded Controller
  program) stored in the ThinkPad computer to fix problems, add new functions,
  or expand functions as noted below.

  For that purpose, it is necessary to have the CD/DVD/BD writing software (with
  CD/DVD/BD creation function from the ISO image file) prepared separately.

  Also, any one of the following types of CD-RW, CD-RW & DVD Combo, DVD, DVD
  Multi, BD or other optical drives should be prepared. (Hereafter these drives
  are called as "optical drive".)
  - ThinkPad internal
  - USB

  This program is language independent and can be used with any language system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES

- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 2.55 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 2.55 for degrading security function.

- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 2.50 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 2.50 because the new 10-digit part
  number and serial number format was once installed. The old UEFI BIOS with the
  7-digit part number and serial number format can not handle the 10-digit
  format.

- Be aware that the OS Optimized Defaults option in the Restart menu of ThinkPad
  Setup should not be normally changed. Lenovo recommends to use the factory
  default setting for it, as follows.

                                                       OS Optimized Defaults
  - For Windows 8.1/8 64-bit Preload models                      [Enabled]
  - For Windows 8.1/8 32-bit or Windows 7 Preload models         [Disabled]

  To install the retail edition of Windows 8.1/8 64-bit, the OS Optimized
  Defaults option should be [Enabled].

  If the OS Optimized Defaults setting is changed, Setup Default by the F9 key
  will not load the same default configuration, as follows. Furthermore, by the
  condition of Operating System installation, the computer may not be booted due
  to the setting change.

  If your computer runs satisfactorily now, you have no need to change the OS
  Optimized Defaults option. If you need to change the setting, consider well
  the effect of the setting change.

  Affected Setup menu items :
  "OS Optimized Defaults" setting          [Disabled] case      [Enabled] case
  - Security
    - UEFI BIOS Update Option
      - Secure RollBack Prevention         [Disabled]           [Enabled]
    - Secure Boot
      - Secure Boot                        [Disabled]           [Enabled]
  - Startup
    - UEFI/Legacy Boot                     [Both]               [UEFI Only]
    - UEFI/Legacy Boot Priority            [Legacy First]       (Not shown)
    - CSM Support                          [Yes]                [No]

  By the OS to be newly installed, you need to change the OS Optimized Defaults
  option, and load default configuration.

  1. Enter the ThinkPad Setup menu by following steps in [Checking On ThinkPad
     Setup] in the DETERMINING WHICH VERSION IS INSTALLED section.
  2. Select Restart, then select OS Optimized Defaults and press Enter.
  3. Select the following setting and press Enter.
       [Enabled]   (for Windows 8.1/8 64-bit)
       [Disabled]  (for Windows 8.1/8 32-bit, Windows 7 or Windows XP)
  4. Press the F9 key to load default configuration.
  5. Select Yes.
  6. Press the F10 key to save default configuration and exit.
  7. Select Yes.
     The computer will be restarted automatically.

- Lenovo recommends to install the USB 3.0 driver for Windows (Version 1.0.4.225
  or higher) prior to updating the UEFI BIOS. Because the UEFI BIOS requires the
  modification in the USB 3.0 driver to fix USB 3.0 related issues.

- To enable 30 Day standby feature of ThinkVantage Power Manager, the computer
  has to disable waking computer by network adapters and USB devices. Uncheck
  the checkbox next to "Allow this device to wake the computer" in the Power
  Management tab for each device in Device Manager.

- You should install the CD/DVD/BD writing software which supports CD/DVD/BD
  creation function from the ISO image file to create the BIOS Update CD.

- To boot the computer from the BIOS Update CD, you should have any one of the
  following types of optical drives.
  - ThinkPad internal
  - USB
  Any types of other optical device like ExpressCard device are not supported.

- The contents of the BIOS Update CD can not be shown by Windows Explorer.
